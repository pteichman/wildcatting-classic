Wildcatting is a minimally multiplayer networked game.  All
functionality can be reached from the go-wildcatting script, which
uses rug/cvs style commands and argument parsing.

You run the server on one computer:

 `$ go-wildcatting server`

And the client on another:

 `$ go-wildcatting client --host <serverhost> [--game gameid]`

Running the client with no `--game` argument will start a new game on
the server.  You will see a lobby that shows the gameid and the
players who have joined.

Share that gameid with your friends, and they can run the client with
`--game gameid` to join.

Once everyone has joined, the first player presses any key and the
game begins!

The oil field view shows the sites that have been surveyed.  Navigate
to a site using the arrow keys and press space to survey, then decide
if you want to drill.  You cannot survey a site that has already been
surveyed.

The drilling view shows you how far down you have drilled and how much
money that operation has cost so far.  You can stop drilling at any
time by hitting "q", or hit the space bar to continue drilling.

==Weekly Report==

On the weekly report, you'll see all your wells.  You can sell a well
at any time by navigating to it and hitting the space bar.  Navigate
to "NEXT PLAYER" and hit space to end your turn.
