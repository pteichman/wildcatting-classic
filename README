"I suppose you're looking to drill the next Spindletop," the surveyor said,
hanging his hat on a hook by the office door.  "I don't know if you'll
find it out here in West Texas, but hell.  We'll do anything honest to
make a living."

Wildcatting
===========

Welcome to Wildcatting!  The year is 1902, and you've traveled to West
Texas from back East to secure your name as an oil speculator.  You
have hired a top-notch surveying team and are prepared to go deeply in
debt to make the find of the century!

Do you believe in the drillbit?  To win at Wildcatting, you'll need to 
painstakingly analyze surveyor's reports to determine if oil lurks somewhere
beneath the crusty soil.  And if you decide to drill, you better believe, 
because for each foot you drill, you'll be paying and paying big.  How deep
are you willing to go?

Even if you find oil down there, don't think the government isn't going to 
notice.  For each week you keep your well operational, you'll be paying 
through the roof just to keep the taxman off your back.  And just because a
well is producing doesn't mean it will continue to do so.  Closely monitor
oil market price trends and well output, and sell at just the right moment 
or even your best well will drain YOU dry.

Still interested?  The life of a wildcatter isn't easy, but the payoffs can
be big.  If your well output outstrips the extortionary tax rate, and you get
a little luck in the oil market, you can get healthy real quick playing 
Wildcatting.

Gameplay
========

Wildcatting is a minimally multiplayer networked game.  All
functionality can be reached from the go-wildcatting script, which
uses rug/cvs style commands and argument parsing.

You run the server on one computer:

 $ go-wildcatting server

And the client on another:

 $ go-wildcatting client --host <serverhost> [--game gameid]

Running the client with no --game argument will start a new game on
the server.  You will see a lobby that shows the gameid and the
players who have joined.

Share that gameid with your friends, and they can run the client with
--game gameid to join.

Once everyone has joined, the first player presses any key and the
game begins!

Oil Field View
--------------

The oil field view shows the sites that have been surveyed.  Navigate
to a site using the arrow keys and press space to survey, then decide
if you want to drill.  You cannot survey a site that has already been
surveyed.

Drilling View
-------------

The drilling view shows you how far down you have drilled and how much
money that operation has cost so far.  You can stop drilling at any
time by hitting "q", or hit the space bar to continue drilling.

Weekly Report
-------------

On the weekly report, you'll see all your wells.  You can sell a well
at any time by navigating to it and hitting the space bar.  Navigate
to "NEXT PLAYER" and hit space to end your turn.
