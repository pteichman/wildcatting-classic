#summary Oil reservoirs are the underlying structure that will allow us to implement sapping between adjacent sites

For some people, games aren't fun unless there is a way to screw over other players.  For these people, playing for one's own in-game interests isn't good enough.  To make Wildcatting as inclusive as possible, we need to acknowledge such anti-social players by supporting game play that allows such behavior without disturbing the original spirit of the game.

It has been proposed that pumping oil from a site adjacent to an existing site should affect  the production capacity of the original.  This could lead to interesting hardships.


= Details =

_OilReservoir_ will be the server object that allows us to implement this.  

For each site, the presence of oil will be determined the normal way based on the site probability.  A second pass for the field will create one reservoir object per set of adjacent sites.  Each reservoir will have a set amount of oil.  Any wells pumping out of a given reservoir will be reducing that supply of oil.

After a ramp up period, weekly well output will be proportional to the amount of oil remaining in the reservoir.
