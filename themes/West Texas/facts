In 1916, Dr. Johan A. Udden believed there an oil-supporting underground fold of rock running under the University of Texas. Though erroneous, Udden's theory led to the first major oil discovery in the West Texas Permian Basin.
Luis de Moscoso, a survivor of the DeSoto expedition, recorded the first sighting of oil in Texas.
Texas Light Sweet Crude is more formally known as West Texas Intermediate (WTI)!
Texas Light Sweet is a type of crude oil used as a benchmark in oil pricing and is the underlying commodity of oil futures contracts.
The Corsicana oilfield developed gradually and peaked in 1900, when it produced more than 839,000 barrels of oil.
The first economically significant discovery of oil in Texas came in 1894 in Navarro County near Corsicana.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is a light crude, lighter than Brent Crude. It contains about 0.24% sulfur, rating it a sweet crude.
Thousands of Texans have been touched by Texas' black gold through the philanthropy of people who have made fortunes from its discovery, production and processing.
Prices for WTI are quoted at Cushing, Oklahoma, which is a major crude oil shipment point that has extensive pipeline connections to oil producing areas and Southwest and Gulf Coast-based refining centers.
